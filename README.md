## Agile Season documentation

Welcome to the [Agile Season](https://agileseason.com) documentation!

### Getting started

- [Your first board](/pages/your_first_board)
- [Keyboard Shortcuts](/pages/shortcuts)

### Features

#### Protect your secrets
We won't be able to read or change your code,
since we won't require any of these permissions from GitHub

#### Many repositories in one view
Connect any number of GitHub repositories to a single board

#### Customizable workflow
Add and remove columns to fit how your team works

#### Connected to GitHub in real-time
Agile Season connects directly to your GitHub issues,
so there’s no duplicate work and you’re not jumping backand forth between tools

#### Reports

- [Issues Frequency](/pages/reports/issues-frequency)
- [Time in Progress](/pages/reports/time-in-progress)
